Primary buttons, buttons that indicate a call to action, are the most prominent. Secondary buttons, which indicate less commonly used actions, should be less prominent than primary buttons. Buttons always indicate an action and are not to be used for navigation. Buttons are placed where a user should expect them, i.e. in close proximity to the other elements that the action affects.</p>\n<h2>Size and Padding</h2>\n<p>Buttons used in this design system have a minimum size of 30px by 30px. This is the typical size of a user\'s finger pad when using the application on mobile. For web this minimum size is also consistent.</p>\n<p>The more white-space, padding, around a button, the more prominent the button appears on the page. Most buttons in this system use 15px of padding, unless are otherwise indicated.</p>\n<h2>Labels</h2>\n<p>Button labels should be clear and specific. Avoid generic terms like Save, Submit or Cancel. Buttons should indicate the exact action that is taken and should provide a clear idea of what will happen next.</p>\n<p>Examples of good button labels: Add a blog post, Send message, Save draft.</p>\n<p>All labels should capitalize only the first letter of the label.</p>\n<p>Label text has high contrast with the button colour. See Colour for more information about acceptable contrast.</p>\n<h2>Varying States</h2>\n<p>Buttons are not one-state objects. Most users will recognize a button because of its hover and active states. Varying states also provide feedback to the user at each stage of performing the action.</p>\n<p>Buttons should include normal, hover, focus, active and disabled states:</p>\n<p><strong>Normal:</strong> Even in its normal state, a button should look like a button! Before hovering, a user should be able to tell that an element is clickable.</p>\n<p><strong>Hover:</strong> Usually indicated by a change in colour or animation, hover states indicate to the user that the element is clickable.</p>\n<p><strong>Focus:</strong> Similar to hover states, focus states indicate that the user has tabbed to the specific button.</p>\n<p><strong>Active/Pressed:</strong> Usually indicated by a change in colour or animation, this indicates that the user has clicked or pressed a button</p>\n<p><strong>Disabled:</strong> Usually a ghosted version of the normal state, this indicates to the user that the action is unavailable.</p>\n<h2>Primary Buttons</h2>\n<p>Primary buttons identify a call to action. Use these buttons for actions that a user is encouraged to take, such as: Add a blog post, Send message, or Login. Try to keep button labels limited to one or two words.</p>\n<p>Primary buttons are designed to have high contrast against the background and the heaviest visual weight. They typically use brighter colours than other elements on the form or layout, and are located in a visible and accessible area of the page.</p>\n<p>Primary buttons use the primary colour, with white text. Sizing of the button depends on the length of the action words.</p>\n<p>Each of the states for primary buttons are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Regular state:</strong> primary colour at 100% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Example of primary button in regular state" color="primary">Regular</button>\n<codeblock html=\'<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>\' react=\'<Button color="primary">Primary</Button>\'></codeblock></p>\n<p><strong>Hover state:</strong> primary colour at 80% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Example of primary button in hover state" color="primary" style="color: #fff; background-color: #245e83; border-color: #215679">Hover</button></p>\n<p><strong>Focus state:</strong> primary colour at 80% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px. Includes a 3px stroke in the primary colour.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Example of primary button in focus state" color="primary" style="background-color: #002D42; box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.2rem rgba(0, 45, 66, 0.25);">Focus</button></p>\n<p><strong>Disabled state:</strong> primary colour at 60% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Example of primary button in disabled state" color="primary" disabled="true">Disabled</button>\n<codeblock html=\'\n    <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" disabled>Disabled</button>\n\' react=\'\'></codeblock></p>\n<h3>Position</h3>\n<p>Primary buttons should be located in the most prominent and convenient location possible. These buttons should also be located in close proximity to the form or the elements that are affected by the action. Generally, in a set of two, primary buttons are placed on the left and the secondary button is placed on the right.</p>\n<h2>Secondary Buttons</h2>\n<p>Secondary buttons are used for actions that are necessary to provide, but that users may click less often. Examples include actions such as Cancel submission, Delete or Save draft. These buttons have a visual weight that is equal to or less than the majority of elements on the page. The secondary button is usually placed in close proximity to the primary button. Try to keep button labels limited to one or two words.</p>\n<p>Secondary buttons, particularly ones used for destructive actions, should be designed in a way that deters users from clicking on it. This helps minimize mistakes.</p>\n<p>For permanent destructive secondary actions, such as Delete, clicking the button will prompt a dialog to confirm the action. Always give the user to confirm actions that cannot be reverted.</p>\n<p>Secondary buttons in this system are transparent with a stroke colour. Text changes colour depending on the button state. Sizing of the button depends on the length of the action words.</p>\n<p>Each of the states for secondary buttons are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Regular state:</strong> transparent with a 1px stroke using the  colour <badge style="background-color: #002D42;">#002D42</badge>, the text is written in the same colour. Border radius of 4px and padding of 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Example of secondary button in regular state" color="secondary">Regular</button></p>\n<p><codeblock html=\'<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>\' react=\'<Button color="secondary">Secondary</Button>\'></codeblock></p>\n<p><strong>Hover state:</strong> rectangle coloured with <badge style="background-color:#002D42;">#002D42</badge> at 80% opacity, the text is displayed in white.

Border radius of 4px and padding of 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Example of secondary button in focus state" color="secondary" style="color: #002D42; background-color: transparent; box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.2rem rgba(0, 45, 66, 0.25);">Focus</button></p>\n<p><strong>Disabled state:</strong> Fill colour of <badge style="background-color: #CECECE;color:black;">#CECECE</badge>, with white text. Border radius of 4px and padding of 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Example of secondary button in disabled state" color="secondary" disabled="true">Disabled</button></p>\n<p><codeblock html=\'<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" disabled>Secondary</button>\' react=\'<Button color="secondary" disabled>Secondary</Button>\'></codeblock></p>\n<h3>Position</h3>\n<p>Secondary buttons are usually in close proximity to the primary button, but not in a location where the user might mistake the two. Secondary buttons are usually placed to the right of the primary button_. _They should have a consistent placement relative to the primary button to avoid confusion.</p>\n<h2>Drop-Down Buttons</h2>\n<p>Drop down buttons display a list of items when clicked. They are used for two-step processes that may require more specific options for a singular action.</p>\n<p><strong>Regular State:</strong> Similar to the primary button, drop-down buttons use the primary colour at 100% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px. The drop-down arrow represents a space of 30px by 40px, which is separated from the primary button using a white line. The arrow uses a space of 15px width and 8px in height.</p>\n<mdbuttondropdown color="primary" title="Regular">\n</mdbuttondropdown>\n<p><codeblock html=\'\n    <div class="dropdown">\n        <button class="btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle" type="button" id="dropdownMenuButton" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">\n            Dropdown button\n        </button>\n        <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownMenuButton">\n            <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a>\n            <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a>\n            <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\' react=\'\n<ButtonDropdown direction="down" isOpen={this.state.dropdownOpen} toggle={this.toggle} style={{marginBottom: "15px"}} color={this.props.color}>\n    <DropdownToggle caret {...this.props}>\n        Reply\n    </DropdownToggle>\n    <DropdownMenu>\n        <DropdownItem>Action 1</DropdownItem>\n        <DropdownItem>Action 2</DropdownItem>\n        <DropdownItem>Action 3</DropdownItem>\n    </DropdownMenu>\n</ButtonDropdown>\n\'></codeblock></p>\n<p><strong>Hover States:</strong> Similar to the primary button, drop-down buttons use the primary colour at 100% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px. The drop-down arrow represents a space of 30px by 40px, which is separated from the primary button using a white line. The arrow uses a space of 15px width and 8px in height. Whichever piece of the button (primary or drop-down section) is being hovered over is shown at 80% opacity.</p>\n<mdbuttondropdown color="primary" style="color: #fff; background-color: #245e83; border-color: #215679" title="Hover">\n</mdbuttondropdown>\n<p><strong>Focus State:</strong> Similar to the primary button, drop-down buttons use the primary colour at 100% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px.

The action box uses a 1px border using <badge style="background-color: #CECECE;color:black;">#CECECE</badge>. The box has a border radius of 4px. The width of the box is 166px, and the height depends on the number of actions, using 40px per action.

Les boutons primaires, les boutons qui indiquent un appel à l’action, sont les plus importants. Les boutons secondaires, qui sont moins couramment utilisés, devraient être moins apparents que les boutons primaires. Les boutons indiquent toujours une action et ne doivent pas être utilisés pour la navigation. Les boutons sont placés où un utilisateur s’attend à les voir, c’est-à-dire à proximité des autres éléments liés à l’action concernée.</p>\n<h2>Taille et remplissage</h2>\n<p>Les boutons utilisés dans ce système de conception ont une taille minimum de 30px par 30px. C’est la taille moyenne du coussinet tactile utilisé pour une application sur un appareil mobile. Pour le Web, cette taille minimale est également uniforme.</p>\n<p>Plus il y a de l’espace vide et de remplissage autour d’un bouton et plus ce dernier apparaît comme important sur la page. La plupart des boutons dans ce système utilisent un remplissage de 15px, à moins d’indication contraire.</p>\n<h2>Étiquettes</h2>\n<p>Les étiquettes de boutons devraient être claires et précises. Évitez les termes génériques comme Enregistrer, Soumettre ou Annuler. Les boutons devraient indiquer l’action exacte qui est prise et devraient fournir une idée claire de ce qui se passera ensuite.</p>\n<p>Exemples de bonnes étiquettes : Ajouter une publication au blogue, Envoyer un message, Enregistrer le brouillon.</p>\n<p>Toutes les étiquettes devraient mettre seulement la première lettre en majuscule.</p>\n<p>Le texte de l’étiquette doit avoir un fort contraste avec la couleur du bouton. Voir les couleurs pour plus de renseignements au sujet d’un contraste acceptable.</p>\n<h2>États variables</h2>\n<p>Les boutons ne sont pas des objets ayant un seul état. La plupart des utilisateurs reconnaissent un bouton en raison de son état stationnaire et son état actif. Les divers états offrent également de la rétroaction à l’utilisateur à chaque étape de l’exécution de l’action.</p>\n<p>Les boutons devraient comprendre les états normal, sensitif, accentué, actif et désactivé :</p>\n<p><strong>Normal</strong> : même dans son état normal, un bouton doit ressembler à un bouton! Avant d’être stationnaire, un utilisateur devrait être capable de dire si un élément est cliquable.</p>\n<p><strong>Sensitif</strong> : habituellement indiqué par un changement de couleur ou une animation, l’état sensitif indique à l’utilisateur que l’élément est cliquable.</p>\n<p><strong>Accentué</strong>: semblable à l’état sensitif, l’état accentué indique que l’utilisateur a placé son curseur sur le bouton précis.</p>\n<p><strong>Actif ou appuyé</strong>: habituellement indiqué par un changement de couleur ou une animation, cela indique que l’utilisateur a cliqué ou appuyé sur un bouton.</p>\n<p><strong>Désactivé</strong> : habituellement une version fantôme de l’état normal, cela indique à l’utilisateur que l’action n’est pas disponible.</p>\n<h2>Boutons primaires</h2>\n<p>Les boutons primaires identifient un appel à l’action. Utilisez ces boutons pour des actions qu’un utilisateur est encouragé à prendre comme : ajouter une publication à un blogue, envoyer un message ou ouvrir une séance. Essayez de limiter les étiquettes de boutons à un ou deux mots.</p>\n<p>Les boutons primaires sont conçus pour avoir un haut contraste avec le fond d’écran et pour avoir le plus de poids visuel. Ils utilisent généralement des couleurs plus vives que les autres éléments sur le formulaire ou la mise en page et sont situés dans un espace visible et accessible de la page.</p>\n<p>Les boutons primaires utilisent les couleurs primaires avec du texte blanc. Les dimensions du bouton dépendent de la longueur des mots d’action.</p>\n<p>Voici les caractéristiques de chacun des états pour les boutons primaires :</p>\n<p><strong>État normal</strong> : Couleur primaire à 100 % d’opacité, texte blanc avec une bordure d’un rayon de 4px et d’un remplissage de 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Exemple d\'un bouton primaire en état normal" style="margin-top: 5px;" color="primary">Normal</button></p>\n<p><codeblock html=\'<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Normal</button>\' react=\'<Button color="primary">Normal</Button>\'></codeblock></p>\n<p><strong>État stationnaire</strong> : Couleur primaire à 80 % d’opacité, texte blanc avec une bordure d’un rayon de 4px et d’un remplissage de 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Exemple d\'un bouton primaire en état sensitif" color="primary" style="color: #fff; background-color: #245e83; border-color: #215679">Stationnaire</button></p>\n<p><strong>État accentué</strong> : Couleur primaire à 80 % d’opacité, texte blanc avec une bordure d’un rayon de 4px et d’un remplissage de 15px. Comprends un trait de 3px dans une couleur primaire.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Exemple d\'un bouton primaire en état accentué" color="primary" style="background-color: #002D42; box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.2rem rgba(0, 45, 66, 0.25);">Accentué</button></p>\n<p><strong>État désactivé</strong> : Couleur primaire à 60 % d’opacité, texte blanc avec une bordure d’un rayon de 4px et d’un remplissage de 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Exemple d\'un bouton primaire en état désactivé" color="primary" disabled="true">Désactivé</button></p>\n<p><codeblock html=\'<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" disabled>Primaire</button>\' react=\'<Button color="primary" disabled>Désactivé</Button>\'></codeblock></p>\n<h2>Emplacement</h2>\n<p>Les boutons primaires devraient être situés à l’endroit le plus important et le plus visible. Ces boutons devraient également être situés à proximité du formulaire ou des éléments qui sont touchés par l’action. En général, dans un ensemble de deux, les boutons primaires sont situés à gauche et le bouton secondaire est placé à droite.</p>\n<h2>Boutons secondaires</h2>\n<p>Les boutons secondaires sont utilisés pour des actions qui sont nécessaires, mais dont les utilisateurs peuvent utiliser moins souvent. Voici quelques exemples d’actions : Annuler la soumission, Supprimer ou Enregistrer un brouillon. Ces boutons ont un poids visuel qui est équivalent ou moindre à celui de la majorité des éléments sur la page. Le bouton secondaire est habituellement placé à proximité du bouton primaire. Essayez de limiter les étiquettes de boutons à un ou deux mots.</p>\n<p>Les boutons secondaires, surtout ceux utilisés pour des actions de destruction, devraient être conçus d’une manière qui dissuade les utilisateurs de cliquer sur celui-ci. Cela aide à réduire le nombre d’erreurs.</p>\n<p>Pour des actions secondaires de destruction permanente, comme Supprimer, cliquer sur le bouton ouvrira une boîte de dialogue afin de confirmer l’action. Toujours prévenir l’utilisateur que les actions confirmées ne peuvent pas être inversées.</p>\n<p>Les boutons secondaires dans ce système sont transparents avec une couleur de trait. Le texte change de couleur selon l’état du bouton. Les dimensions du bouton dépendent de la longueur des mots d’action.</p>\n<p>Voici les caractéristiques de chacun des états pour les boutons :</p>\n<p><strong>État normal</strong> : Transparent avec un trait de 1px utilisant la couleur <badge style="background-color: #002D42;color:white;">#002D42</badge>, le texte est écrit dans la même couleur. La bordure est d’un rayon de 4px et le remplissage de 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Exemple d\'un bouton secondaires en état normal" color="secondary">Secondaire</button></p>\n<p><codeblock html=\'<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondaire</button>\' react=\'<Button color="secondary">Secondaire</Button>\'></codeblock></p>\n<p><strong>État sensitif</strong> : Un rectangle coloré avec no002D42 à 80 % d’opacité, le texte est écrit en blanc.

La bordure est d’un rayon de 4px et le remplissage de 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Exemple d\'un bouton secondaires en état accentué" color="secondary" style="color: #002D42; background-color: transparent; box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.2rem rgba(0, 45, 66, 0.25);">Accentué</button></p>\n<p><strong>État désactivé</strong> : Remplissage de couleur <badge style="background-color: #CECECE;color:black;">#CECECE</badge> avec du texte blanc. La bordure est d’un rayon de 4px et le remplissage de 15px.</p>\n<p><button aria-label="Exemple d\'un bouton secondaires en état désactivé" color="secondary" disabled="true">Secondaire</button></p>\n<p><codeblock html=\'<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" disabled>Secondaire</button>\' react=\'<Button color="secondary" disabled>Secondaire</Button>\'></codeblock></p>\n<h2>Emplacement</h2>\n<p>Les boutons secondaires sont habituellement placés à proximité du bouton primaire, mais pas à un endroit où l’utilisateur peut confondre les deux. Les boutons secondaires sont habituellement placés à droite du bouton primaire. Ils devraient avoir un emplacement uniforme par rapport au bouton primaire afin d’éviter la confusion.</p>\n<h2>Boutons de menu déroulant</h2>\n<p>Cliquer sur les boutons de menu déroulant affiche une liste d’éléments. Ces boutons sont utilisés pour des processus en deux étapes qui pourraient nécessiter plus d’options particulières pour une seule action.</p>\n<p><strong>État normal</strong> : Semblables aux boutons primaires, les boutons de menu déroulant utilisent une couleur primaire à 100 % d’opacité, du texte blanc avec une bordure d’un rayon de 4px et un remplissage de 15px. La flèche du menu déroulant représente un espace de 30px par 40 px, qui est séparé du bouton primaire en utilisant une ligne blanche. La flèche utilise un espace de 15px de largeur et de 8px de hauteur.</p>\n<mdbuttondropdown color="primary" title="Normal">\n</mdbuttondropdown>\n<p><codeblock html=\'\n    <div class="dropdown">\n        <button class="btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle" type="button" id="dropdownMenuButton" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">\n            Normal\n        </button>\n        <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownMenuButton">\n            <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a>\n            <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a>\n            <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\' react=\'\n<ButtonDropdown direction="down" isOpen={this.state.dropdownOpen} toggle={this.toggle} style={{marginBottom: "15px"}} color={this.props.color}>\n    <DropdownToggle caret {...this.props}>\n        Normal\n    </DropdownToggle>\n    <DropdownMenu>\n        <DropdownItem>Action 1</DropdownItem>\n        <DropdownItem>Action 2</DropdownItem>\n        <DropdownItem>Action 3</DropdownItem>\n    </DropdownMenu>\n</ButtonDropdown>\n\'></codeblock></p>\n<p><strong>État sensitif</strong> : Semblables aux boutons primaires, les boutons de menu déroulant utilisent une couleur primaire à 100 % d’opacité, du texte blanc avec une bordure d’un rayon de 4px et un remplissage de 15px.
