Things that don't sync up with the deployed/current/master version:

SITE ISSUES:
-> Search is missing proper text / translated text (Please don't try to fix this without asking Addison! I18n is done differently on this branch!)
-> Sidenav/Subnav and Header active property isn't showing properly (we switched to gatsby-link since {Link} from 'gatsby' is only v2 )
          |-> If this doesn't fix itself by syncing with the final master, it should be simple to reprogram!
          |-> Note the gatsby v2 branch / deployed version is also bugged so it might be best to just recode it in tomorrow

MD FILE ISSUES:
-> UncontrolledCollapse not working on IE (forEach not defined)
