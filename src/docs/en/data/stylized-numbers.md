# Stylized Numbers

Stylized numbers are a great addition to a statistics dashboard, or other content that visually represents data. Stylized numbers are used to emphasize certain statistics and quickly show an increase or decrease.

Stylized numbers are styled as follows:

*Stylized number component*

Number shown at Rubik Regular at 125 points. Text underneath the number and offset to the left. Text uses Heading 4 style \(Rubik Regular at 21 points\). Underneath the text and number the percentage is shown using Heading 5 style. The chevron on the left of the percentage shows either an increase or decrease.

A decrease uses a chevron coloured <badge style="background-color: #923534">#923534</badge> and an increase uses <badge style="background-color: #2B542C">#2B542C</badge>
