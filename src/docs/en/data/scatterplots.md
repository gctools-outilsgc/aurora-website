# Scatterplots

Scatterplots are used to show correlation between points of data with two variables.

## Best Practices

Trend lines aren't necessary, but may help to emphasize correlations in your data. Only use trend lines if they accurately represent a strong correlation.

To show clusters of data, use varying opacity levels on overlapping or near-overlapping data points to show layers, and make each point visually distinct.
