# Content Formatting

## Capitalization

All capitalization in the system uses sentence case. Titles, buttons, navigation etc. all use sentence case capitalization, which means only the first letter of the first word is capitalized. Always capitalize the first letter of proper nouns. Table headings and page titles should use headline style, which means the first letter of each word (with the exception of and, but, the) are capitalized.

Acronyms and abbreviations should be avoided. Write out acronyms and abbreviations whenever possible. Acronyms should only be used if  the acronym is more commonly understood than the full name (i.e. NATO)

Acronyms and abbreviations should always be capitalized. Acronyms do not require a period after each letter.

## Dates, Numbers and Addresses

Dates are always posted spelling out the entire date (e.g. July 12, 2018). For timestamps on posts, dates can be spelled out (i.e. one day ago, one week ago), until (x) after the content has been posted.

Numbers up to ten are spelled out, any other number is showed using regular digits, and rounded to two decimals if necessary (e.g. 2.35)

Addresses should always start with the building number, then street name, and the street type abbreviated (e.g. 140 O'Connor St.) If an apartment or unit number is required, it should be included before the building number and use a dash in between (i.e. 6-90 Elgin St.)

If required, province, territories should be included using their shortened forms (i.e. ON) and country names should be spelled out.

## Time

Time in this system is formatted using the 12-hour clock. For events and other content requiring time, time will be displayed as hour:minutes (e.g. 6:00 p.m. or 3:00 a.m.) For timestamps on posts, time can be spelled out  (i.e. 4 minutes ago, one week ago) until (x) after the content has been posted.  

## Units of Measurement

Units of measurement in this system will always use the metric system.

## Ampersands

System messaging and text will never use ampersands. Instead, spell out the word "and".

## Commas, Ellipses, Colons
This system does not use the Oxford comma. Commas should only be used when they improve the flow and clarity of the sentence.
Generally ellipses should be avoided as they imply uncertainty. Only use an ellipses to show omitted text.

Colons in this system are used to introduce lists.

Typically, dashes should be avoided. It is better to break the complex sentence into two sentences.  

## Slashes and Hyphens
Slash marks are used to show alternatives (and/or etc.). When joining conflicting elements, use a hyphen (designer-writer).

## Bold and Italics
Bold can be used to show emphasis. In this system, bold in favoured for certain header types (see headers). Italics should be avoided as they are not easy to read for all users.

## Quotation Marks
Quotation marks are used around direct quotes. Quotation marks can also be used to show that a word is being used ironically, however this should only happen within body text, and never functional text and labels.
