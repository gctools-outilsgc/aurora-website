The Digital Collaboration Division is consistently updating and iterating on Aurora design system to make Aurora even better! Here’s a look at what we’re planning for future versions:

## Version 1.2

add do/don’t images for context and distribution files for developers.
These fixes and updates are:
Fixes

## Version 1.3
In Version 1.3 we will be adding navigation elements, as well as a page including our UX research based on design system content. We will also address fixes based off of user feedback from Version 1.2.

These updates include: 
* Drawers and accordions
* Header and Footer
* Sidebar
* Tabs
* Alternative Text article
* Research page for DS-related studies
  
## Version 2
Version 2 includes a major update including an identity section based on the OADW brand, additional resources, and common layouts. We will also address fixes based off of user feedback from Version 1.3.

Identity section:
* Values and mission statement

* Voice and tone

Resources section:

All of this versioning is subject to change. Aurora will continue to iterate in an agile method, meaning that we will address issues and plan updates based off of changing priorities and user feedback.
