## User interface kit

Our user interface kit was built in Adobe Illustrator and is perfect for building prototypes and page designs. Each component can be exported and brought into Adobe XD to create interactive prototypes and web pages.

The UI kit is also great for implementing Aurora styles into different types of content such as banners, documents, presentations, and promotional materials.
