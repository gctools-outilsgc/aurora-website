# Tags, Chips and Pills

## Tags

![](.gitbook/assets/tags.png)

Tags represent a set of user-generated keywords that help label, organize and categorize content. They are useful because they provide metadata that makes content searchable. Tags can be added or removed from content by the author.

Tags are usually displayed near the title of the content, in close proximity to other information such as the date posted, number of likes and author.

Tags are rectangular with a border radius of **4px**. The left side of the tag is stylized using a **triangle and white circle**.\_**\(revisit this\)**\_Tags use the secondary colours in the chosen palette, and the text colour will be either black or white depending on the tag colour. Refer to the colour section for more information on which text colours to use.

Tags may also include a right-aligned remove button beside the text. This button is represented as a black/white circle with a transparent x.

Tags are sized to match the length of the keywords with padding of **7px** on the top, right and bottom, and **10px** on the left.

## Chips

Chips represent contact information, typically including a user's avatar and name, with a link to their profile.

Chips are rectangular with a border radius of **4px**. An avatar image is displayed on the left side of the chip. Chips are sized to match the length of the user's profile name. Chips have padding of **7px** on all sides.

Chips have 3 different variations and are displayed as follows:

**Normal:** Rectangular box filled in with ****CECECE. Black text. Small avatar \(**26 x 26px**\) aligned to the left.

**User-control:** Same as normal, but there is an additional remove icon on the right. This icon is 4D5D6C with a transparent x, and is right-aligned. Small avatar \(**26 x 26px**\) aligned to the left.

**Hover:** Same as the user-controlled chip but has a background colour of 4D5D6C and the remove icon is white with a transparent x. Small avatar \(**26 x 26px**\) aligned to the left.
