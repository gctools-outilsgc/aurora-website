# Menus


Menus are used to display lists of choices the user can select. Menus can be used for lists of actions, as well as a form of navigation.

## Best Practices

Menus must contain at least two items, and each item should only be a single line of text. Menus can be exited by clicking outside of the menu, or by selecting the action, unless multiple actions can be selected, or selecting a navigation point. Menus should be labeled clearly and concisely. Menus should typically only have one level of nesting.

## Action Menus

### Best Practices

Action menus are temporary lists of choices a user can make. They can consist of both ****primary actions and options which affect the page. Menu items can contain icons, and checkboxes. ****Menus should be internally scrollable.

Action menus can be static or contextual. Static menus have fixed options; contextual menus change their options based on what is available to select. Menu items can be ordered either statically \(always in the same order\) or dynamically \(changing based on previous user interaction\).

### Simple Menus

Simple menus are used for mobile and tablet only. They use vertically-aligned nesting to reveal menu options, in order to reduce horizontal bulk. The nest should appear on top of the emitting element, slightly left-aligned. The selected item should be highlighted, and positioned on top of the emitting element.

## Mega-menus

Mega-menus are used when your navigation points have subcategories. The navigation points are grouped together with like items, under a title header. All items should be visible at the same time. Mega-menus can have multiple columns.
