# Back to top

Back to top is a navigation button that allows users to quickly revert back to the top of a particular web page. This element is shown in the bottom right corner of the page or mobile screen. The element only appears when the user scrolls \_**\(distance\)** \_a certain amount down the web page.

Back to top buttons are necessary for web pages with continuous scrolling, or a page that includes a long amount of content. A good guideline is to include a Back to top_button for any web page that is longer than 4 screens.

This button should always be labelled _Back to top_ since this is the most descriptive and expected label for the function.

Back to top buttons in this design system are styled as follows:

*Back to top component*

White circle with a radius of 43px. Border is 1px \#CECECE. Drop shadow of \#000000 20% opacity, 0 offset for x, 2px offset for y, **2px** blur.

There is an arrow icon centred in the circle \(_Arrow up_ from Font Awesome\). The arrow is coloured \#666666

*Back to top-web component*

The text Back to top is styled using button text \(Nunito Sans Bold, 14px\), with the colour \#666666.

The text has a 9px by 15px padding with a 1px border colours \#CECECE and a border radius of 16px. The arrow icon is aligned to the left of the text.
