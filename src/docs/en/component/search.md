# Search

Search bars help the user find relevant content within your site or application. Search bars are a universal feature that is expected on most sites, particularly ones with large amounts of content.

Search bars are located in the top-right of the webpage, and function similarly to a form field, where the user can input keywords to create an output from the system.

Search bars in this system use placeholder text using the term _Search_

There are two style options for search:

**Option 1**

Text field with a padding of 12px. On the right of the field there is a search icon that serves as an action button. The icon is sized at 1.2 em and coloured with <badge style="background-color: #666666">#666666</badge>.

**Option 2**

The same as option 1 with a border radius of 17px.
