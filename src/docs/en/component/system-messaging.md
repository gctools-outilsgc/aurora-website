# System Messaging

System notifications are short messages that appear to communicate information to the user. Notifications appear as pop-up banners which need to be dismissed or timed-out. There are four levels of severity which can be applied to the notifications: error, warning, information and success.

Design systems notifications in descending level of severity:

### Error

<codeblock html='
    <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
        Error: You have done something wrong
    </div>
' react='
<Alert color="danger">
    Error: You have done something wrong
</Alert>
'></codeblock>


Error notifications are used for system failures and user errors.

Error example: “Your password must contain at least 8 characters.”

### Warning

<codeblock html='
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
        Warning: You are about to make a mistake
    </div>
' react='
<Alert color="warning">
    Warning: You are about to make a mistake
</Alert>
'></codeblock>

Warning notifications are used for notices of potential future errors.

Warning example: “Caps lock is on which may cause you to enter your password incorrectly.”

### Information

<codeblock html='
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        Information: This may be useful to you
    </div>
' react='
<Alert color="info">
    Information: This may be useful to you
</Alert>
'></codeblock>

Information notifications are used to provide additional information and notes to the user which they may find helpful in context.

Information example: “You can change your password in settings.”

### Success

<codeblock html='
    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
        Success: You just did something and it worked
    </div>
' react='
<Alert color="success">
    Success: You just did something and it worked
</Alert>
'></codeblock>

Success notifications are used to confirm that a task was completed successfully.

Success example: “Your password was updated successfully.”

## Style of Notifications

### Design

The notifications are designed with the same concept of simplicity found in the mood boards. There is enough colour in the banners to provide visual impact which catches the user’s attention, but not so much as to overpower the user’s **field of vision**.

The font icons are from Font Awesome, and were chosen due to their simple design and universality.

A drop shadow is used to show the user that the notification can be closed by clicking the “X” button. The drop shadow has a **1px X-axis**, a **1px Y-axis** and an opacity of 23%.

### **Colours**

The colours used for notifications are from the design system’s palette.

Hex colour for error notifications: \#D3080C

Hex colour for warning notifications: \#FF9900

Hex colour for information notifications: \#269ABC

Hex colour for success notifications: \#278400

### **Position**

Notifications should be located at the top of the page, or wherever is most convenient and visible for the user.

### **Font**

The font used for notifications is the design system standard font Nunito Sans Regular. The notification title is in black and **16pt** in size. The notification message is in black and **14pt** in size. The font sizes were chosen for high visibility and easy readability. However, the size of the font may vary based on the display size, device used or how long the notification message is.

### **Size and padding**

Notifications are **62px by 425px**. The text has a **15px** padding on the top and on the bottom, and a **30px** padding from the left. The corners are rounded to **2px**. Padding sizes can vary based on how long the message will be. Padding is used to make text more pronounced in order to separate the message content from the background content.

### **Notification Messages**

The notification messages should straightforward and as short as possible, and use key words. Long messages can be unclear and may affect the sizing and readability of the message.

Example of a clear notification: Your profile picture has been changed successfully.

#### Timing-out

Notifications are automatically timed-out to improve the flow of the website. The timing-out of notifications is based on the conservative estimate of a reading speed of 200 words-per-minute.

Short notifications \(70 characters or fewer\) should be timed with a:

* Show animation of 0.4 seconds.
* Show duration of 3.5 seconds.
* Hide animation of 1 second.

Long notifications \(70-140 characters\) should be timed with a:

* Show animation of 0.4 seconds.
* Show duration of 7 seconds.
* Hide animation of 2 seconds.

If your notification will be longer than 140 characters, consider a different method of communicating the message.
