# Badges


Badges are used to show notifications and other alerts related to a particular element. Badges do not stand alone, but are combined with text, icons or buttons to show a change or action related to that feature. For example, a badge beside your Inbox link to show the number of unread emails.

When coding badges, the alternative text that will be read by screen readers should also include context. For example, the badge should read "40 unread emails" instead of just "40".

Badges in this design system appear as follows:

Rectangle with a width of 28px and height of 19px. Border radius of 8px. Background colour of <badge style="background-color: #4D5D6C;">#4D5D6C</badge>. Text colour of <badge style="background-color: #FFFFFF;color:black;">#FFFFFF</badge>. Text is centred within the rectangle.
