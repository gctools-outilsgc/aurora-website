# Tooltips

## Usage

Tooltips are text labels containing informative text that appear when users hover over, long-press, or focus an element. Tooltips provide short descriptive text about their associated element.  

## Best Practices

Tooltips should be as short as possible and provide additional information for buttons or form inputs.

Tooltips are always used for supplemental information. Essential information that clarifies an action or demonstrates requirements for a form input, should always be immediately visible on the page.

## Styling

In their regular state, tooltips are styled as follows:

Tooltips are placed 12px away from the element it is describing. Tooltips are contained within a rectangle with a padding of 5px by 7px, with a border radius of 4px, and a fill colour of <badge style="background-color: #666666">#666666</badge> with a 90%. The text is displayed using Nunito Sans Regular at 14px in <badge style="background-color: #FFFFFF; color: black">#FFFFFF</badge>.
